## 5. auto_mpg data
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG  
The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes, which contains 398 instances, what we need to predict is mpg value. Attributes for each instance  
1. mpg: continuous 
2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete 
3. displacement: continuous 
4. horsepower: continuous 
5. weight: continuous 
6. acceleration: continuous 
7. model year: multi-valued discrete 
8. origin: multi-valued discrete 
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)

## 6. airfoil self-noise data
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Airfoil+Self-Noise  
NASA data set, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel, which contains 1503 instances. Attributes for each instance
1. Frequency, in Hertzs  
2. Angle of attack, in degrees   
3. Chord length, in meters  
4. Free-stream velocity, in meters per second   
5. Suction side displacement thickness, in meters   
The only output is:   
6. Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels
